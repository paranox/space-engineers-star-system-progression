Additional configs to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2590306434]Star System Progress V2[/url] for Daily Needs Survival Kit, providing emergency rations in respawn pod prefabs.

In either a Cargo Container or Cockpit/Seat inventory you will find:
- 10 Emergency Rations (1 full bar)
- 2.5 Drinking Water Packets (2 full bars)
- Semi-Automatic Pistol
- 4 full clips of ammunition

In O2/H2 Generator you will find, as not changed by this mod:
- Oxygen Bottle (full)
- Hydrogen Bottle (full)
- 300 litres of ice.

In addition the pods might have tanks containing O2 or H2, and this mod doesn't change that.

This addon makes Pertam starts very hard, as there's no ice to speak of. It will be necessary to collect unknown signals, or to raid NPCs and maybe even other players to get drinking water from ice. You'll need to drink your recycled urine a lot, naturally.
