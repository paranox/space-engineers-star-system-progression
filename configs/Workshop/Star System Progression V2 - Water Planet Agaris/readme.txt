Additional configs for Planet Agaris and Water Mod, basically just new oremaps for the planet.

[h2]Agaris Start[/h2]
An easy start with a breathable atmosphere, ground water even in deserts, rich in basic construction ores plus plenty of cobalt and magnesium. While mostly spread out, ore placements also follow the original ore map to some extent. Especially the rare ores are almost never found elsewhere.

You want to get to asteroids or Moon for silver and gold, they're really scarce on the planet itself.

[h2]Planetary stats[/h2]
I've not changed gravity and atmosphere parameters of Agaris.

[h3]Procedurally Generated Ore[/h3]
I've used this tool to generate ore maps for all official planets including Triton. However, I still haven't found out how to modify surface boulders on Triton.

In many cases the ores with low numbers are up to 300m deep in the ground and plentiful rare ones are usually closer to surface than they normally would. The numbers below are not directly comparable between planets and moons due to surface area differences.

[h2]The Scenario[/h2]
This mod is used in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2072120819]this scenario[/url] and it defines the star system itself.
