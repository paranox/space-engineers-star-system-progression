A system of planets and their moons around a gas giant.

Asteroids spawn only as rings around planets Triton and Pertam as well as visible ring of the gas giant.

EarthLike was replaced with Water Planet Agaris, other planets are from official Star System.

All oremaps are custom and planetary attributes have been altered for all but Agaris.

Basically you usually need to get to asteroids or moons for silver and only moons provide plentiful gold. Other planets will provide for whatever you don't reliably get where you started.

Asteroids spawn only around Triton, Pertam and the visible rings of Gas Giant "Poseidon". They won't have Uranium nor Platinum in them, but other resources will be available in them, Gold and Silver quite rarely but in larger veins, sometimes ice as well.

## Starting options

### Poseidon Gas Giant
Please don't start here, even though it's enabled. It is a silly place.

### Agaris Water Planet
An easy start with a breathable atmosphere, good winds and rich in basic construction ores. Plenty of Cobalt and Magnesium to be found too. Surface water for ice collectors and underground water even in deserts.

### EarthLike's Moon "Luna"
A really hard start with no atmosphere, so no winds, and ice only at the poles. Average basic construction ores with plentiful Silicon but very scarce Cobalt. Good sources of Magnesium, Silver and Gold. Lack of Cobalt ore creates a situation where fighting NPCs is the most reliable source of it.

### MarsLike Planet
A really hard start with a thin atmosphere, weak winds and no oxygen. You need to quickly find ice inside surface boulders or at the poles. While Platinum is plentiful and found closer to surface, Cobalt is more scarce and deeper. Same as on Earth starts you need to get to the moon Europa for a reliable source of Gold, and plentiful ice, but Silver isn't common there either.

### Europa Moon
A hard start with a very thin atmosphere and weak winds, plentiful ice for oxygen though. Basic construction ores are not too common and Silver is rare but Gold and especially Magnesium are easily found. Getting to orbit or Mars might really be necessary for any progress.

### Alien Planet
Either a really hard start or a normal one depending on whether spiders are enabled or not. Has a dense unbreathable oxygen atmosphere with a fairly strong gravity field and strong winds. Rich in everything except Gold, Uraninite and Platinum.

### Titan Moon
A hard start with a very thin atmosphere, weak winds and no oxygen. You can find ice lakes around the surface for the most part. Cobalt is plentiful and found close to surface, good amounts of basic construction ores and Gold can be found, but almost no Silver.

### Triton Planet
A normal start with a breathable atmosphere but very high gravity and very strong winds. Relatively rich in all basic construction ores and even has some moderate amounts of Uraninite. Getting off this planet is a challenge but once you do you'll be rather well equipped. There is no moon, so scouting asteroids are needed for Silver and Gold.

### Pertam Planet
A normal start with a breathable, noticeably thinner atmosphere but strong winds and higher gravity compared to EarthLike. There is no ice to speak of on this planet, so getting off the planet is challenging. The planet has only low amounts of basic construction ores, only little bit of Magnesium, but rather high amounts of all rare ores, especially Uraninite. There is no moon, but asteroids can provide easier access to Magnesium and construction ores.

## Daily Needs Survival Kit
If you are using this mod addon, prepare for a really hard start on Pertam where you will need to resort to scavenging and raids for sources of ice. On the other hand starting on Agaris would really easy.
